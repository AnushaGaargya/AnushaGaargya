- ⚡ Fun fact: The first Apple logo isn’t what you would think. Originally, it featured Sir Isaac Newton sitting beneath a tree, with an apple about to fall on his head. It was designed back in 1976 and featured a phrase around the border that read “Newton…A mind forever voyaging through strange seas of thought…alone”.
